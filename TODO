DONE

	Sketch out input packets and read them in XDP

	Setup join request and join response packets

	Client sends join requests until join response

	Hack up server time to be nanoseconds since boot and return in join request packet

	Read the server time in nanos and print it in client.go

	Estimate round trip latency in milliseconds using sent time vs. receive time for join request.

	Set client time to RTT/2 plus some safety (100ms for now, to exaggerate effect...)

	Implement input processing logic

	Simple case.

TODO

	Complex case. Walk the inputs up to max in packet

	Forward the input packet to userspace for processing, eg. AF_XDP socket

	https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/networking/af_xdp.html

	Scale up and implement a simple system with input and state per-player
