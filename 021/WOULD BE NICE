WOULD BE NICE

-----------

Would be really nice for world database cells to be represented simply as a convex volume, eg. a set of planes within which if the player happens to be within those planes then the player shallow state is sent to that world database.

This way the action of the player servers could be completely decoupled from the geometry of the world databases.
