DONE

	Modify the index server so it defines the world dimensions and grid size.

TODO

	I think it's important to generalize the definition of the world into zones.

	The zones map to world databases.

	Each zone is defined as a collection of one or more convex volumes.

	This should be generic enough to loosely define any shape.

	While in the 

	-----------
	
	On player server connect, send down the definition of the world config to the player server, so it knows it.

	-----------

	Implement world database connecting to index server and then being assigned to an open cell. 

	The world database should be informed post connect which cell it is, and what it's bounds are.

	Initially bounds could be an AABB, but eventually could be a convex zone defined by planes.

	-----------

	I like the idea of having a constant time lookup in a static structure, eg. a grid for taking a position and getting the set of world database zones that are subscribed.

	-----------

	Player servers need an update per-second for world database servers

	-----------

	This way I can just spam world database instances and they will autoassign on join.

	-----------

	World server keeps track of which player server a player is on, via the player shallow state update.

	Hack up world server raycast (pick random player)

	When player is returned pass tag + session id

	-----------

	Implement damage player
